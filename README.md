# BootcampWebsite

## What is it?
In this project we make a website which simulates an online food ordering system, in which you can choose from a selection of dishes on a menu. Once the order is complete, the program shows the total amount that has to be paid.

## Execution
The front-end of this project is a website, which can be accessed through the following link:
